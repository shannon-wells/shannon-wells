## Hi! I'm Shannon 🍓
Welcome to my profile. I'm a recent graduate student, question asker, world traveler, and sometimes I do personal data analysis projects.

I have experience in economic development and policy anaylsis. What led me to data science was its application in the social
science space and my desire to figure out how to improve community and indidivual outcomes through modeling. I'm passionate about
learning how to add structures of equity within the modeling process to ensure samples are representative of actual populations. 


My Hobbies include:
- Gardening 🪴
- Economic theory
- Reading webcomics and books📖
- Forgetting to practice SQL
